## 🔐 API Key Transparency

This project is open-sourced to ensure full transparency.

Users provide their own **Google Gemini API key** via the in-app settings UI. Keys are stored **locally in your browser** (`localStorage`) and are **never sent to any server** controlled by the author.

All AI requests run **client-side** from your browser directly to Google's Gemini API. You are encouraged to review the source code to verify this.

**Supported key formats:** Legacy `AIza…` keys and newer `AQ.…` auth keys from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Upload Multiple Files**: Upload old + new resumes, portfolios, and project docs. AI merges them intelligently
2. **Detailed Job Descriptions**: The more detail you provide, the better AI can tailor your CV
3. **Use AI Review**: Run review before applying. It catches missing keywords, weak bullets, and ATS issues
4. **Fix with AI**: When review flags missing contact info or data, open the fix dialog and paste the real values before applying
5. **Re-analyze After Fixes**: Always re-analyze after Fix with AI to confirm your score improved
6. **AI Modifier**: Use natural language for one-off edits ("Add React to skills", "Update bio to focus on leadership")
7. **PDF vs Screen**: On-screen templates are rich/visual; downloaded PDFs are clean single-column layouts optimized for recruiters and ATS parsers
8. **Cover Letter**: Let AI generate it first, then use AI Modifier to refine tone or length
